<p><strong> Hello! ðŸ‘‹ </strong></p>
<p><strong> I'm Halimah Omogiafo! </strong></p>

Iâ€™m building <a href="https://www.koody.co" target="_blank">Koody</a>, a personal finance app and stock market research platform headquartered in London, UK.

My background is in finance and entrepreneurship, having worked in banking and fintech startups for a few years. I also have an MBA and studied finance as an undergraduate.

I only started learning to code a few years ago, and itâ€™s increasingly becoming my favourite thing to do.

My goal here is to improve my coding skills (become a 10x engineer ðŸ˜‰), meet interesting people, participate in open-source projects, and have fun along the way.
