<p><strong> Hello! ðŸ‘‹ </strong></p>
<p><strong> I'm Halimah Omogiafo! </strong></p>

Iâ€™m building <a href="https://www.koody.co" target="_blank">Koody</a>, a personal finance app and stock market research platform.

I started learning to code a few years ago, and itâ€™s increasingly becoming one of my favourite things to do ðŸ˜Š

My goal here is to improve my coding skills (become a 10x engineer ðŸ˜‰), meet interesting people, contribute to open-source projects, and have fun along the way.
